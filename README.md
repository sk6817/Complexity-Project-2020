##Oslo Model

This is one of two computational projects from Complexity and Networks Module 19/20. Taught in the Department of Physics, Imperial College London.

Abstract: The self-organisation and criticality of the Oslo Model were studied. The model was implemented on Python. I focused on two main quantities of the Oslo model, which are the height of the pile and the avalanche-size probability. In each quantity, the finite-size scaling effects were studied. It was found that they follow a power-law behaviour with the corresponding critical exponents, which signifies their scale-free behaviour. Using these exponents, the data could be collapsed into functions of one variable for various system sizes. For avalanche size probability, the critical exponents obtained were T = 1.5574 ± 0.0052 and D = 2.2417 ± 0.0042. It is remarkable to see how this scale-free behaviour emerges by just defining very simple local dynamical rules.
